# Logistic Regression

## In statistics, the (binary) logistic model (or logit model) is a statistical model that models the probability of one event (out of two alternatives) taking place by having the log-odds (the logarithm of the odds) for the event be a linear combination of one or more independent variables ("predictors"). In regression analysis, **logistic regression** (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (the coefficients in the linear combination). Formally, in binary logistic regression there is a single binary dependent variable, coded by a indicator variable, where the two values are labeled "0" and "1", while the independent variables can each be a binary variable (two classes, coded by an indicator variable) or a continuous variable (any real value).
